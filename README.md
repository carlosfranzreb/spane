# SpkAnon Eval

![Workflow badge](https://github.com/carlosfranzreb/spkanon/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

Evaluation framework for speaker anonymization models.

## Installation

The evaluation framework can be installed with `pip install .`. Alternatively, the script `build/framework.sh` creates a conda environment and installs the framework there, as well as `ffmpeg`. Audiofiles are loaded with `torchaudio`. To load MP3 files, `ffmpeg` is required. You can install it with `conda install 'ffmpeg<5'`, as is done in the build script.

If you want to evaluate the naturalness of your synthesized speech with NISQA, clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gabrielmittag/NISQA.git`. This is also done in the build script.

Once the framework is installed, you can run the tests with `python -m unittest discover -s ./tests`. The test audio files are already part of the framework.

## Full results of the SPSC 2023 paper

The results that were used on the aforementioned paper can be found on a previous commit of this repository. We have removed them from the current version to simplify the repository. Here is a link under which the results can be found: <https://github.com/carlosfranzreb/spkanon_eval/tree/28f27eb>. The notebooks summarizing the results are under `scripts`.

## Existing anonymization models

We have moved the anonymization models to a separate repository, as well as the build scripts required for them. They are:

- **STT-TTS with Whisper & FastPitch**: extracts the text from the input speech and synthesizes it with one of the 20 FastPitch target speakers.
- **StarGANv2-VC**: voice conversion model trained with 20 target speakers of VCTK.
- **SoftVC**: install it with build/softvc.sh does not require any further installation. Read more about this pipeline here.

You can find the components, build instructions and evaluation results in the `spkanon_models` repository: <https://github.com/carlosfranzreb/spkanon_models>.

## Evaluate your anonymization model

To evaluate your own model, you have to implement the required wrappers. We also have implemented several components which you might find useful. Read about them [here](docs/components.md). You can also look at the existing anonymization models to learn more about this framework. They are stored in [this repository](https://github.com/carlosfranzreb/spkanon_models).

Alternatively, you can define an `infer` method on your model and replace the current model in the `spkanon_eval/main.py` file. The `infer` method should anonymize and unpad batches. See `featex_eval.anonymizer.Anonymizer.infer` to learn how we do it.
