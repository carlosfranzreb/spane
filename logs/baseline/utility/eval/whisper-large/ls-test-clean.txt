/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0007.flac 1 45 0.02 Habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times. If the behaviorist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit, that can only be because he trusts his memory, when it assures him that there have been other times.

/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0010.flac 2 36 0.06 We sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague, which yet we do not trust. For example, under the influence of fatigue, we may see a friend's face vividly and clearly, but horribly distorted.

/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0015.flac 0 21 0.0 They must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past.

/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0017.flac 0 20 0.0 There may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of pastness, especially where immediate memory is concerned.
/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0018.flac 1 27 0.04 There is, of course, a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present, and knowing the time order of two remembered events.
/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0019.flac 0 44 0.0 It would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present. But it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events.

/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0021.flac 0 17 0.0 Remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered.

/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0024.flac 1 16 0.06 The first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past.
/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0025.flac 1 56 0.02 We might provisionally, though perhaps not quite correctly, define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analog in our knowledge of the future. Such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned, though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy.
/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0026.flac 0 27 0.0 This distinction is vital to the understanding of memory, but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory.

/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0032.flac 0 11 0.0 It is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge.
/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0033.flac 0 29 0.0 It is by no means always reliable. Almost everybody has at some time experienced the well-known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time.
/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0034.flac 0 37 0.0 Whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object, it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object, which leads us to the judgment, this is familiar.
/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0035.flac 0 17 0.0 Thus, no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone.
/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0036.flac 0 5 0.0 A further stage is recognition.
/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0037.flac 0 52 0.0 Recognition, in this sense, does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association. The kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment.
/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0038.flac 2 55 0.04 We are, of course, in fact, able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before. But this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense, and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word.
/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0039.flac 0 13 0.0 This knowledge is memory in one sense, though in another it is not.
/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0040.flac 1 40 0.03 There are, however, several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate. To begin with, it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as, I have seen this before, than as, this has existed before.
/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0041.flac 0 36 0.0 The definition of my experience is difficult. Broadly speaking, it is everything that is connected with what I am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important.
/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0042.flac 0 46 0.0 Thus, if I recognize a thing, the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which I recognize it, forms part of my experience, by definition. Recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world.
/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0043.flac 0 55 0.0 Of course, the words, this has existed before, are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition, but that is unavoidable. Words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive, and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition.

/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0002.flac 0 45 0.0 By being studious of color they are studious of division, and while the chiaroscurist devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing, unseparated light, the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light.
/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0003.flac 1 32 0.03 My first and principal reason was that they enforced, beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them, this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side.

And the best skill of art is in instantly seizing on the manifold deliciousness of light, which you can only seize by precision of instantaneous touch.
/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0009.flac 2 70 0.03 Now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is enclosed properly and harmonized with the other hues, it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper. And that I am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all around it, being sure that even the little diamonds in the round window will tell as jewels if they are gradated justly.

/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0013.flac 0 8 0.0 It must, remember, be one or the other.

/ds/audio/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0015.flac 0 49 0.0 The law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly, or at least, only in such mist or faintness as shall be delightful. And I have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground.

And then is the question, can I round him off, even though he is black, and make him slimy, and yet springy and close down, clotted like a pool of black blood on the earth, all the same?
