"""
RAVDESS is an emotional dataset, where the information of each utterance is summarized
in the filename. The filename is of the form:
    03-01-06-01-02-01-12.wav

Filename identifiers

1. Modality (01 = full-AV, 02 = video-only, 03 = audio-only).
2. Vocal channel (01 = speech, 02 = song).
3. Emotion (01 = neutral, 02 = calm, 03 = happy, 04 = sad, 05 = angry, 06 = fearful, 07 = disgust, 08 = surprised).
4. Emotional intensity (01 = normal, 02 = strong). NOTE: There is no strong intensity for the 'neutral' emotion.
5. Statement (01 = "Kids are talking by the door", 02 = "Dogs are sitting by the door").
6. Repetition (01 = 1st repetition, 02 = 2nd repetition).
7. Actor (01 to 24. Odd numbered actors are male, even numbered actors are female).
